# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Zustand

Zustand is a fast and scalable state management solution built by the developers of Jotai and React springs. Zustand is known for its simplicity, using hooks to manage states without boilerplate code.

## Project
In this project, I have implement following feature:

* Counter App to get the count, increase and decrease count on button count
* Vote App to get the no. of votes, increase, decrease vote on button count and Fetch Votes list asynchronously on button click 
* Pokemon App to fetch pokemon list asynchronously on Component Mount
* Fruit App for Storing, Accessing and Persisting arrays in the state

### `npm start`
